// Generic container for anything shown directly over the wallpaper
// (no windows open, nothing else on screen)  -  visualizer+lyrics+clock.
// Gated only on "is the wallpaper actually showing" (see
// ScreenBorder.qml's Loader)  -  NOT on whether music is playing, since
// the clock should show regardless of that. The music section gates
// its own visibility on MediaService.isPlaying internally instead.
//
// Layout reasoning (v2  -  fixes clock/visualizer sometimes overlapping):
// each element anchors to a DIFFERENT reference point instead of both
// competing for the screen's true center:
//   - Clock: anchored near the TOP (independent of center entirely)
//   - Visualizer: anchored at the screen's true center  -  this is now
//     its own anchor point, not shared with the clock, so however
//     tall the clock's text happens to render, it can never reach
//     down into the visualizer's space.
//   - Lyrics: hang below the Visualizer's own bottom edge, not
//     anchored to the screen at all  -  they just follow wherever the
//     visualizer actually ends up.
