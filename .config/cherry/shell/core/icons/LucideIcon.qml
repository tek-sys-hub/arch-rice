    // Re-enabled  -  the intermittent "sometimes doesn't show" issue was
    // very likely an async race, not a caching bug: if `icon` changes
    // twice in quick succession (e.g. an initial "" before the real
    // binding settles), asynchronous decode of the FIRST request can
    // complete AFTER the second one starts, so the wrong/stale result
    // wins. Disabling cache made every load "fresh" (masking the race)
    // but at the cost of re-decoding the same SVGs repeatedly  - 
    // confirmed via QML Profiler as dozens of redundant PixmapCache
    // reloads for icons used across many buttons (palette, chevron-
    // right, camera, ...).
    //
    // Forcing synchronous loading closes the race directly instead:
    // for icons this small (~24px SVGs), synchronous decode is
    // effectively instant, so there's no real cost to not being async,
    // and now there's no window for a stale async result to win.
