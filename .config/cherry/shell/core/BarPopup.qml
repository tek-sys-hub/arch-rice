// Was a PopupWindow  -  its own separate Wayland surface, created/
// mapped fresh on first open. Rewritten as a plain Item, reparented
// into the SAME already-live window that hosts the bar/drawers
// (visualWindow in ScreenBorder.qml)  -  the same window already proven
// smooth for Dashboard/ControlCenter/SystemDrawer. No new surface ever
// gets created just to show a popup anymore.
//
// Two consequences of no longer being its own window:
//   1. Positioning is relative coordinates (x/y) within the shared
//      window instead of anchor.rect  -  targetItem.mapToItem(parent, ...)
//      does the same job anchor.rect's screen-relative math did.
//   2. Hit-testing needs an explicit mask carve-out (a plain Item has
//      none of its own)  -  see ShellState.registerPopup/unregisterPopup
//      and ScreenBorder's mask Region slots over activePopupItems.
