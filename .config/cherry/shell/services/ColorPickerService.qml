// Runs hyprpicker and copies the result  -  extracted out of
// QuickActions.qml into its own singleton (same reasoning as
// TimeService/CalendarService) specifically because the ORIGINAL
// wiring was broken: QuickActionsContent.qml (a separate file) tried
// to call `root._runColorPicker()`  -  `root` is QuickActions.qml's own
// BaseDrawer id, not visible across a file boundary no matter how
// deeply nested inside a Component block. A plain "QuickActions.
// _runColorPicker()" call elsewhere in the same file assumed
// QuickActions was a singleton, which it isn't either. Making this a
// real singleton means ANY file can just call
// ColorPickerService.run() directly, no cross-file scope issues.
//
// We capture hyprpicker's stdout ourselves and copy it via wl-copy,
// rather than relying on hyprpicker's built-in -a/--autocopy flag  - 
// that depends on wl-clipboard being present and has been flaky on
// some versions. Doing it explicitly guarantees the copy happens,
// and lets us show a notification with the picked color.
