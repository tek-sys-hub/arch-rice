    // Which BarPopup Items currently need to be interactive  -  i.e.
    // included in ScreenBorder's mask (see chat: BarPopup switched
    // from its own separate PopupWindow surface to a plain Item
    // reparented into the already-live visualWindow, same approach
    // that's already smooth for Dashboard/ControlCenter/SystemDrawer.
    // A plain Item has no interactivity of its own outside whatever
    // the window's mask carves out for it  -  this list IS that carve-
    // out, built dynamically in ScreenBorder via a Repeater).
    //
    // A LIST, not a single item  -  multiple bar popups can genuinely
    // be open at once (e.g. the tray menu open via click while
    // separately hovering an unrelated widget's own popup).
    //
    // Registered the INSTANT a popup's showPopup becomes true,
    // unregistered the INSTANT it becomes false  -  deliberately NOT
    // tied to the popup's own fade-out animation. A closing popup
    // becomes click-through immediately rather than staying
    // interactive for the whole fade  -  concretely, this is what fixes
    // (structurally, not just patches) a fading popup "resurrecting"
    // itself if the cursor happens to pass back through it afterward:
    // it's no longer in the mask, so input passes straight through to
    // whatever's actually behind it.
