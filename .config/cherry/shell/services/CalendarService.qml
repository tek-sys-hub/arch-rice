// Shared "which month is the calendar currently browsing" state  -  a
// separate singleton from TimeService on purpose: TimeService is the
// read-only wall clock, this is user-navigable browsing state
// (next/previous month). Kept as one shared instance for the same
// reason as TimeService itself  -  if this widget is ever shown on more
// than one screen, browsing to "next month" on one screen should stay
// in sync everywhere, not just wherever you clicked.
//
// NOTE: because this is a singleton, browsing state now persists
// across the calendar widget closing and reopening (e.g. closing and
// reopening the Dashboard)  -  navigate to next month, close, reopen
// later the same day, and it's still showing next month rather than
// resetting to today. If you'd rather it always reset to the current
// month on reopen, say so and we'll add that explicitly.
