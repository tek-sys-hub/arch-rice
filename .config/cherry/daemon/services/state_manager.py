StateManager  -  owns ~/.cache/cherry/state.json exclusively.

style is split into three explicit scopes instead of one flat
namespace, matching who actually reads what:

  shared:   colorN, background, foreground, cursor, radius, fontName  - 
            anything both Quickshell (bar/widgets) and Hyprland need.
  shell:    Quickshell-only knobs (barHeight, widgetOpacity, ...).
  hyprland: Hyprland-only knobs (gaps, blur, shadow, cursor size, ...).
